      <h2>Wait... aren&apos;t fees bad?</h2>
      <p>Numbers aren&apos;t good or bad, they&apos;re just numbers!</p>
      <p>
        However, total fees can be a strong indicator for which protocols have actual economic
        activity behind them.
      </p>

      <h2>Can you add information about fees-per-transaction?</h2>
      <p>
        CryptoFees.info doesn&apos;t just show data for layer-1 blockchains, it also shows fees for{' '}
        blockchain applicaitons, like decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, etc.
        Fee-per-transaction isn&apos;t a relevant metric for applications, so it&apos;s not
        included.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, fee-per-transaction implies that all transactions are equivelant. A simple
        token transfer is very different from a DEX trade, HTLC-lock, rollup data block, etc.
      </p>

      <h2>Where does this data come from?</h2>
      <p>
        Fee data comes from various sources. Data for many of the layer 1 chains comes from{' '}
        CoinMetrics, while data for many of the applications comes from Graph Protocol subgraphs.
      </p>
